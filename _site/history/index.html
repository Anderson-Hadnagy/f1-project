        <h2>The Dangerous Years (1950-1970)</h2>
        <p>When F1 started in 1950, it was incredibly dangerous. Drivers raced in simple shirts with leather helmets. There were no seatbelts, and tracks were lined with trees and ditches.</p>
        <p><strong>Juan Manuel Fangio</strong> was the hero of this era, winning 5 titles in 7 years. In the 1960s, teams like Lotus introduced <em>aerodynamics</em> (wings) to push the cars into the ground for more grip.</p>

        <h2>The Turbo & Tech Era (1980-1999)</h2>
        <p>Engines became smaller but much more powerful using Turbochargers, reaching over 1000 horsepower. This era was defined by the rivalry between <strong>Ayrton Senna</strong> and <strong>Alain Prost</strong>.</p>
        <p>Following the tragic death of Senna in 1994, the sport underwent a massive safety revolution, introducing stronger crash structures and better helmets.</p>

        <h2>The Hybrid Era (2014-Present)</h2>
        <p>In 2014, F1 switched to V6 Turbo Hybrid engines. These are the most efficient engines in the world, recovering energy from heat and braking to charge a battery.</p>
        <p>Mercedes dominated this era with <strong>Lewis Hamilton</strong>, winning 8 consecutive team titles. Recently, Red Bull and <strong>Max Verstappen</strong> raised the bar for perfection.</p>

            <h3>Downforce</h3>
            <p>F1 cars are shaped like upside-down airplane wings. Instead of lifting off, the air pushes them down, allowing them to take corners at 180mph.</p>
        </div>
        <div>
            <h3>G-Force</h3>
            <p>When braking or turning, drivers experience up to 5G or 6G. That means their head feels 6 times heavier than normal! They need massive neck strength.</p>

            <h3>The Halo</h3>
            <p>Introduced in 2018, the Titanium "Halo" bar sits above the cockpit. It can withstand the weight of a London Double Decker bus and has saved many lives.</p>
