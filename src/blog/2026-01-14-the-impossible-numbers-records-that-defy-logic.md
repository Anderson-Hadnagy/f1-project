Formula 1 is a sport measured in thousandths of a second, but its history is written in giant, immovable numbers. While drivers obsess over the next lap, fans obsess over the legacy left behind. In the era of data, some records stand as monuments—seemingly impossible to topple, until the moment they aren't.

### The Century Club

For decades, Michael Schumacher’s 91 wins seemed like a summit no one would ever reach. Then came Lewis Hamilton.

As of today, Hamilton stands alone with **105 Grand Prix victories**. To put that in perspective, legends like Ayrton Senna (41) and Alain Prost (51) combined don't equal his tally. It is a record of longevity and sustained excellence that spans three different decades of racing.

### The Season of Perfection

If Hamilton is the king of longevity, Max Verstappen is the master of the single-season blitz. The 2023 season remains the gold standard for dominance.

Driving the RB19, Verstappen won **19 out of 22 races**—a staggering 86% win rate. He didn't just win the championship; he scored 575 points, enough to win the Constructors' Championship by himself. It was a year where the question wasn't *if* he would win, but by how many seconds.

### The Blink of an Eye

Not every record is about dominance; some are about the razor-thin margins of victory. The closest finish in F1 history happened at Monza in 1971.

Without modern timing transponders, the officials had to rely on photographic evidence. Peter Gethin beat Ronnie Peterson by just **0.01 seconds**. The top five cars crossed the line separated by only 0.61 seconds—a slipstreaming chaotic finish that will likely never be repeated in the era of DRS.

### The Shortest "Race"

History also has its bizarre chapters. The 2021 Belgian Grand Prix holds the dubious record for the shortest race ever held.

Due to torrential rain, the "race" consisted of two laps behind the Safety Car, lasting officially just **3 minutes and 27 seconds**. Half-points were awarded, Max Verstappen was declared the winner, and fans were left wet and bewildered. It stands as a reminder that even in a high-tech sport, Mother Nature still holds the ultimate record.

### The Unbreakable One?

Perhaps the most untouchable record belongs to Luigi Fagioli. In 1951, he won the French Grand Prix at the age of **53 years and 22 days**.

In today’s grid, where teams hire teenagers like Kimi Antonelli before they can legally drive on the road, it is almost impossible to imagine a 50-year-old taking the top step of the podium. This is one number that might truly be safe forever.
