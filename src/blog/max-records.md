In the history of Formula 1, we have seen eras of dominance from Ferrari, McLaren, and Mercedes. But what Max Verstappen and Red Bull Racing achieved in 2023 wasn't just dominance—it was perfection.

### The 86% Win Rate

The most staggering statistic from the 2023 season is the win rate. Max won **19 out of 22 races**.

That is a win percentage of **86.36%**, completely shattering the previous record held by Alberto Ascari since 1952 (which was 75%). For decades, people thought Ascari's record was impossible to beat in the modern era due to reliability issues and longer seasons. Max proved them wrong.

### The Streak That Never Ended

Before 2023, Sebastian Vettel's record of 9 consecutive wins was considered the gold standard. Max didn't just match it; he cruised past it.

He won **10 races in a row**, from Miami all the way to Monza. During that summer stretch, he was literally unbeatable, regardless of weather, track layout, or grid penalties.

### More Than Just a Fast Car

Critics often point to the car, but his teammate Sergio Perez—driving the exact same machinery—finished with less than half of Max's points total. This gap proves that while the RB19 was an engineering marvel, the driver behind the wheel was operating on a level we may never see again.

As we look toward the future, the question isn't "Who can beat Max?" It's "Can anyone stop him from winning every single race?"
